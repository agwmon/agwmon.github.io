I am a MS student at KAIST ([MLAI Lab](https://www.mlai-kaist.com/)), working under the supervision of [Sung Ju Hwang](http://www.sungjuhwang.com/).

My research focuses on computer vision and deep learning, in particular, generative tasks using multimodal foundation models, such as text-to-image models. Currently, my main interest include diffusion models and personalization of generative models.

<!-- Here is my [CV](https://Dagwmon.github.io/files/CV.pdf). -->
